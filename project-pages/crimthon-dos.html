          <div class="body-text"> I was tasked to create a layout that would represent our university's Criminal Justice Education department and our office's, UC Innovation and Technology Transfer Office, aesthetic in their joint event. I created various slides with the university's logo and government entities' logo. There's also a slide that doesn't have Lady of Justice in the corner so that the office can have a uniform slide to be used for details. Despite finishing my internship on August, the event was already being planned out before launching it in October of 2022. </div>
          <div class="body-text"> The layouts were created in Canva alone where I utilize the application's stock images. The fonts that I advised to be used for titles and subtexts are Open Sans Extra, Poppins Extra Bold, and Squartica 4F while using colors in these hexacodes, #FFCC53 and #013200 (the university's color).</div>
