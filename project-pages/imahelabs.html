The founders thought the rebranding was necessary since the game had other features than before. We were tasked to create a palette of colors to choose from while incorporating the university's color. We were also tasked to create the design of the achievement which we opted for the creation of a mascot and also icons for the pop-up banner in the game.</div>
          <div class="body-text"> After meetings with the developers, the project sticked with the original logo though there was a change to the color scheme. I was also able to contribute to the app's splash screen using Adobe After Effects. The icons were a joint effort while I designed the character so that my co-interns can use in creating the representation for each achievement using Adobe Illustrator. </div>
