I worked on this video with a co-intern where we collaborated with the university's guidance office for guidelines on what the video should include as well as the duration. The university's president also had a say on what we should focus on and gave us access with the actors,facilities, and equipment to be featured and utilized in the video.</div>

Meanwhile, the clips for each department of the university were compiled in Filmora then edited in Final Cut Pro. </div>
